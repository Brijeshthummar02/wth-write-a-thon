# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the 1st edition of the WriteTech Hub Write-a-Ton API Documentation Challenge in partnership with Chimoney!  
This document outlines how to contribute your submission and what’s required to participate successfully.

## Who can participate?

To take part in this challenge, you **must be a member of the WriteTech Hub community**.  
If you're not yet a member, please join here: [https://writetechhub.org/community](https://writetechhub.org/community)

Once registered, you’ll get access to our Slack workspace where we’ll share:
- Update and resources
- Support during the challenge

## What you’ll be submitting

You will select one Chimoney API endpoint and submit a folder containing three separate Markdown files:

```
submissions/
└── [endpoint]-[your-slackhandle]/
├── use-case.md
├── tutorial.md
└── setup.md
```

Each file represents a deliverable:

1. `use-case.md` — An article explaining a real-world application of the endpoint.
2. `tutorial.md` — A code-based tutorial with sample requests and explanations.
3. `setup.md` — A step-by-step guide for setting up the environment and calling the endpoint.

## Steps to Contribute

### 1. Fork this repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top of this GitHub repo.  
More help: [How to Fork a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

### 2. Create a new branch

From your forked copy, create a new branch using this format:

`[endpoint]-[your-slackhandle]`

**Example:**  

`wallet-zaycodes`

### 3. Add Your submission

Inside the `submissions/` directory, create a folder named:  

`[endpoint]-[your-slackhandle]`

Inside your folder, add:

- `use-case.md`
- `tutorial.md`
- `setup.md`

Use plain Markdown syntax. No PDFs, HTML, or Word documents.

### 4. Open a pull request (PR)

- Push your changes to your forked repo
- Go to the original repository and open a PR to the `main` branch
- Fill in the provided Pull Request template
- Tag your assigned reviewer (this will be shared with you in Slack)

### 5. Submit the final form

Once your PR is opened, complete the submission form (shared via Slack).  

## Review & approval

A reviewer will:

- Check your three deliverables for clarity, structure, accuracy, and usefulness
- Leave comments or request changes
- Approve your PR if everything is complete

✅ Only approved submissions will be scored and considered for rewards.  
✅ Only the WriteTech Hub team will merge pull requests after verification.
