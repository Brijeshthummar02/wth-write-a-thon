# How to Write a Use Case Article

A use case article tells a story — it shows how a specific API can solve a real-world problem for a real user. This is not just about what the API does, but why it matters and how it can be applied.

This guide walks you through writing a compelling and technically sound use case article.

## 1. Define the problem

Start with a relatable, real-world challenge. Help readers understand the context before the API comes into play.

Ask yourself:

- Who is the target user?
- What is their problem or goal?
- Why is it hard to solve without this API?

Example:  
> "Imagine you're building a gig economy app that pays freelance designers across multiple countries..."

## 2. Introduce the API as the solution

Once the reader understands the problem, introduce the Chimoney API endpoint as the tool that solves it.

- Explain which endpoint you're focusing on
- Highlight what it enables the user to do
- Briefly mention how it works (you’ll dive deeper in your tutorial)

Example:  
> "Using Chimoney’s `multi-currency wallet transfer` endpoint, we can send payments to workers in their local currencies — instantly."

## 3. Describe the use case in detail

Be specific and grounded in a real-world flow:

- What does the user or system do first?
- When and how is the API called?
- What result does the user see or experience?

Break it into short sections or bullet points if needed.

Example outline:
- User submits payout request
- Platform validates balance
- Chimoney API is called with wallet and currency info
- Payment confirmation is displayed

## 4. Mention supporting features or considerations

Show how the use case fits into a bigger picture:

- Are there any security/auth requirements?
- Is this use case scalable?
- How does it improve the product or user experience?

## 5. Optional: Visuals or diagrams

If it helps, include a simple diagram or flowchart (Markdown, ASCII, or embed an image) showing the process.

Example:

```
[User] 
   ↓
[App]
   ↓
[Chimoney API]
   ↓
[Payment Processed]
   ↓
[Confirmation]
```

## Checklist before you submit

- [ ] I clearly explained the real-world problem
- [ ] I introduced the API as a relevant solution
- [ ] I described the use case in logical, actionable steps
- [ ] I made it easy to follow, even for someone new to the API
- [ ] My article is structured, concise, and relevant

## Final tip

Avoid being too abstract. Think like a product builder or developer who needs to *see* how this API adds value in their project.
