# ✍️ WriteTech Hub Write-A-Thon Challenge

Welcome to the official Write-A-Thon Challenge series by WriteTech Hub (WTH)!

WTH Write-A-Thon is a technical writing challenge designed to help writers grow through real-world content creation, collaboration with industry partners, and feedback-driven learning. Each edition is run in partnership with a tech organization and focuses on a specific writing format or theme.
